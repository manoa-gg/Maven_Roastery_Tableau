# âœ¨ Maven Roastery Data Analysis âœ¨
This repository showcases a data analysis project focused on understanding sales performance and customer behavior for Maven Roastery, a coffee shop business. The analysis leverages transactional data to identify key trends, top-performing products, and operational insights, aiming to provide actionable recommendations for business optimization.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze Maven Roastery's sales data to:
- Understand the distribution of product categories.
- Identify top-selling products by quantity and average transaction value.
- Analyze revenue and transaction quantity trends based on operational hours.
- Assess transaction patterns (e.g., single vs. multi-item purchases).
- Evaluate store performance across different locations.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset
The analysis is based on the following files:
- `data/maven_roastery_cleaned.csv`: This CSV file contains the raw transactional data, including details such as transaction ID, date, time, store location, product category, product type, product name, item price, transaction quantity, and day of the week.
- `visualizations/Maven_Roastery_Beginner_Viz.pdf`: A PDF document containing a series of visualizations and initial insights derived from the data.

# ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Performed
The analysis covers several key areas:

- **Product Distribution**: A pie chart illustrates the proportion of sales contributed by different product categories (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Bakery).

- **Top 10 Sold Products**: Bar charts detail the top 10 products based on transaction quantity and their corresponding average transaction values.

- **Time-Based Performance**: Line graphs show how revenue and transaction quantity fluctuate throughout the operational day, highlighting peak hours.

- **Transaction Quantity Analysis**: A line graph visualizes the count of transactions based on the number of items purchased, revealing insights into single-item vs. multi-item transactions.

- **Store Performance**: Stacked bar charts and line graphs compare sales performance, transaction quantities, and average transaction values across different store locations (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, Lower Manhattan) and over time.

# ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- **Product Dominance**: Coffee and Tea categories are the primary revenue drivers for Maven Roastery.

- **Peak Hours**: The period between 7 AM and 10 AM is identified as the peak hour for both revenue and transaction quantity, suggesting optimal times for staffing and inventory management.

- **Single-Item Purchases**: The majority of transactions involve a single item, indicating a strong opportunity for implementing bundle strategies to increase average transaction value.

- **Consistent Store Performance**: Revenue and average transaction value differences between the three store locations (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, Lower Manhattan) are minimal, indicating a consistent operational standard across the branches. Hell's Kitchen is noted as the best-performing store.
